## Installation

To get started with the Spotify Downloader, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/sagarika200/Spotify_downloader.git](https://github.com/sagarika200/Spotify_downloader.git)
    cd Spotify_downloader
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you'll need to create one listing all your project's dependencies, e.g., `spotipy`, `youtube_dl`, etc.)

## Usage

Here's how to use the Spotify Downloader:

1.  **Set up API Credentials (if applicable):**
    If your project uses Spotify API, you'll need to set up your Spotify Developer credentials (Client ID and Client Secret).
    * Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).
    * Log in and create a new application.
    * Note down your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
    * (Explain how to provide these credentials, e.g., environment variables, a config file, etc. For example: "Set them as environment variables named `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET`.")

2.  **Run the script:**

    * **To download a single song:**
        ```bash
        python main.py "YOUR_SPOTIFY_SONG_URL_OR_NAME"
        ```
        (Replace `main.py` with the actual name of your main script file if it's different.)

    * **To download a playlist (if supported):**
        ```bash
        python main.py --playlist "YOUR_SPOTIFY_PLAYLIST_URL"
        ```
        (Adjust command-line arguments based on your script's implementation.)

    * (Add more usage examples as per your script's functionality.)
